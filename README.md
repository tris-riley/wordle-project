# introduction 

Based on the popular Wordle, this game gives the user four opportunities to find a randomly generated word. If the user enters the correct word within four attempts, they win the game. 
The randomly generated word is one of the last names of a current Arsenal Football Club player. 

# technologies used
The game utilises HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies. 
The HTML page contains a text input box and buttons that trigger Javascript functions, which, when executed, run several loops and manipulate the DOM to output the result of the user's input. 


# approach 
My initial approach to the project was to build an exact Wordle replica. I spent a  lot of time recreating the design of Wordle; however, when I had completed this, I realised I did not know how to implement Wordle's functionality, nor did I want to create a copy of the game. 

At this point, I encountered one of my first problems, planning before beginning. 
I started again with the functionality and created a text box that checked a user's input against a randomly generated word. Similarly, a lack of planning became an issue for me here, with loops and loop conditions additively implemented as I either came up against problems or made impromptu decisions about what I wanted the app to do. 

I opted to use a custom set of words, with the theme being current Arsenal Football Club players. 
# problems 

### 1.Planning

I did not plan, resulting in less clean code than I would have wanted, and meant that I was adding code as needed, based on issues that arose or subsequent ideas. 

### 2.Design 

A lack of planning also meant I did not consider the app's look or feel, and the design is something I would like to improve. By the time I had come to this conclusion, I had to prioritise my time, deciding to ensure that I achieved the minimum app deliverables over anything else. 

### 3.Commits

I only grasped the benefits of multiple commits and the use of commit messages at the end of my project. Initially, I was not committing much, and then when this changed, I could have used more descriptive messages. Subsequently, I would have had difficulty returning to earlier project implementations. 

### 4.Functionality
I added a loop showing the user what letters contained in their guess were also in the final answer. However, with limited remaining time (see lack of planning again), I could not add functionality that would show the position of the matched letters against the correct answer. 
 

# conclusion 

Overall I found this to be an exciting project, but I would have liked to stretch myself further with more considered design and functionality. I would have also wanted to have attempted the extensions. In the future, I would like to improve my planning process, taking the time to understand what I would like to achieve, utilising pseudocode as a framework for guiding this and design tools such as Figma.
